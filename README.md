# School_Projects
some of my school projects
The three files pa 1,4,6 are all from the same class. datastructures and algorithms.
The machine learning program is the first assignment and only assigment we have had so far, will update and add more once I have turned in more assignments.
The lab 3 project is a basic firewall using open flow and pox. It was ran and tested in mininet, I am also doing one more project for this class that I will add once finished.
Next quarter(starting in march) I will be taking computer systems desgin, and computer archeture adn will be updating this repository. 
I also have several projects in verilog and would be happy to add them if requested. 
I am also currently working on a side project with one of my friends. We are building an app that predicts what movies a user would enjoy. We have just started though so it wont be done for awhile.
I also plan on taking a three quarter senior project next year wich I will add to this.
